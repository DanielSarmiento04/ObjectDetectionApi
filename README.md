## Abstract

Object detections is a common computer vision task used in most common applications. This project leverages a combination of Oat++, OpenCV, and YOLOv8 over c++ 17 to create a robust Object Detection API.

## What is oat++?

Oat++ is a C++ web framework designed to build high-performance and scalable web applications. It is open-source and primarily focuses on providing developers with a simple and efficient way to create RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer) and web services.

- Important Notes:
1. Compatibility with `SQLite`, `PostgreSQL` and `MongoDB`.
2. High demand supported (5 million concurrent).
3. Zero Dependency.

## What is OpenCV?

> Note that actually this project is tested using opencv 4.8.1.

It is a open source computer vision library designed to provide a comprehensive set of tools for image and video processing. Developed in C++ and with bindings available for various programming languages, including `Python`, `javascript` and `java`. OpenCV is widely used in both academic and industrial settings for a range of applications. Its features include image and video manipulation, object detection, facial recognition, feature extraction, camera calibration, and machine learning integration.

## What is Yolo and Yolo v8?


YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. It is a model designed based on SSD architecture. With the passage some group of research was improved this architecture to make faster and update the precision.

Yolov8 is an implementation by [Ultralytics](https://docs.ultralytics.com) group.


## SetUP

To run this project there are two way to compile the solve, the best way to compatibility is using docker, and the second is build the solution using cmake as package involve solution.


1. Download the model 

    ```
    conda create --name object_detection python=3.11 -y
    conda activate object_detection
    pip install ultralytics
    yolo export model=yolov8n.pt format=onnx imgsz=640,480  
    ```
> it almost supports yolo v5  only make sure that image size is `640x480`.


2. Cmake:

    build the oat++ library, to see all cmake params, please go to this [link](https://oatpp.io/docs/installation/unix-linux/)
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/oatpp/oatpp.git
    cd oatpp
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake --build . --config Release 
    sudo make install
    ```

    build the opencv library, will depend ind most cases of your hardware and software installed, but take consider that it project your the dnn component of opencv and it require to compile with ProtoBuf

    If your are using macos and you are use brew as package manager, the las version `4.9.0` don't use protobuf, please install the last `4.8.1`
    
    ```bash 
    brew install --build-from-source ./opencv.rb    
    ```

    Another SO
    
    ```bash
    OPENCV_VERSION="4.8.1"
    MODULE_NAME="opencv"

    wget -O ${MODULE_NAME}.zip https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/${OPENCV_VERSION}.zip && \
    wget -O ${MODULE_NAME}_contrib.zip https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/archive/${OPENCV_VERSION}.zip
    
    unzip -o ${MODULE_NAME}.zip -d ${MODULE_NAME}
    unzip -o ${MODULE_NAME}_contrib.zip -d ${MODULE_NAME}

    cd ${MODULE_NAME}-${OPENCV_VERSION}

    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \
    -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
    -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=../../opencv_contrib-4.8.1/modules \
